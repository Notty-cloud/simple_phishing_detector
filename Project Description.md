# Email Phishing Detection Dataset Manager

## Overview
A simple system that loads public email phishing datasets, extracts key features (like sender info, suspicious keywords, URL patterns), and stores them in an organized format for analysis. This project helps understand how features are prepared for machine learning models that detect phishing emails.

## Purpose
To learn how to work with real-world datasets, extract meaningful features from text data, and organize data for machine learning applications. This project practices data processing, file handling, and basic feature engineering without requiring deep ML knowledge.

## Target Users
Beginner data science students and developers learning about cybersecurity datasets and feature extraction for machine learning projects.

## Skills Practiced
- Working with CSV/JSON datasets
- Text processing and feature extraction
- Data cleaning and organization
- Basic Python programming
- Version control with Git/GitHub
